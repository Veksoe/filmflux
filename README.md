# FilmFlux
This small webpage displays information about movies, fetched from The Movie Database API. 
I have narrowed the scope of the project to focus on implementing a landing page, a watchlist page, and individual movie detail pages.

## How to run..
When visiting the webpage for the first time, you'll need to enter an API Read Access Token, which you can get by signing up at https://www.themoviedb.org/signup.
